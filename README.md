# Visualizing Loans Awarded by Kiva

In this project I visualize insights using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.

Using Seaborn, I explore the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. I also visualize the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
